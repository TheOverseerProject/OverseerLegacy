Now also works on various pieces of item-related code: the accessory system and alchemizing multiple items were coded by him. (Not to mention the randomizer, submission system, consort shop...)</br>';

They all have very similar jobs: take your suggestions and pictures and place them into the actual game. That is the only reason they're all listed together: they are no less important than the rest of the devs by any means!</br>";

Whether its balancing items or moderating submissions, these guys make sure items are suitable for the project.
